Note: all programs is based on my basic knowledge when i was first year college, these are for BEGINNERS only.

Initial Commit
TicTacToe - board game, 2 player, 
TowerOfHanoi - Stack game, strategy
Battleship - board game (grid), guess the target
Distance - Calculate the distance between POINTS by entering their coordinates, i think its trigonometry subject

Adding Binaries Converter using Datastructure
BinaryToDecimal - convert a binary to decimal, example is 101 = 5, it also show the complete solution
DecimalToOctal - convert decimal (whole number) to octal, implement using linked list datastructure
HexadecimalToBinaries - convert hexa to  binaries, complete solution
IntegerToBinaries - convert a decimal (whole number) to binaries, complete solution
DecimalToHexadecimal - convert decimal (whole number) to hexadecimal, complete solution

Math Calculation
Series and Parallel Circuits - calculate circuits, input voltage and the resistance then calculate it show all answers, ECE subject
Area (Pi-Radius) - calculate the Area
Base And Exponents - calculate the Power, (POWER = BASE race to EXPONENT)
FreeFalling - calculate freefalling bodies, lab exercise in physics
GuessTheNumber - game, guess

Adding Datastructure Implementation
InfixToPrefix - convert Infix to Prefix using stack, a datastructure
Bubblesort - arrange the number to ascending, sorting algorithm
