# Basic C Language Programs

Note: all programs is based on my basic knowledge when i was first year college, these are for BEGINNERS only.

###Initial Commit  
1. **TicTacToe** - board game, 2 player,  
2. **TowerOfHanoi** - Stack game, strategy  
3. **Battleship** - board game (grid), guess the target  
4. **Distance** - Calculate the distance between POINTS by entering their coordinates, i think its trigonometry subject

###Adding Binaries Converter using Datastructure  
1. **BinaryToDecimal** - convert a binary to decimal, example is 101 = 5, it also show the complete solution
2. **DecimalToOctal** - convert decimal (whole number) to octal, implement using linked list datastructure  
3. **HexadecimalToBinaries** - convert hexa to  binaries, complete solution
4. **IntegerToBinaries** - convert a decimal (whole number) to binaries, complete solution
5. **DecimalToHexadecimal** - convert decimal (whole number) to hexadecimal, complete solution

###Math Calculation
1. **Series and Parallel Circuits** - calculate circuits, input voltage and the resistance then calculate it show all answers, ECE subject
2. **Area (Pi-Radius)** - calculate the Area
3. **Base And Exponents** - calculate the Power, (POWER = BASE race to EXPONENT)
4. **FreeFalling** - calculate freefalling bodies, lab exercise in physics
5. **GuessTheNumber** - game, guess

###Adding Datastructure Implementation:
1. **InfixToPrefix** - convert Infix to Prefix using stack, a datastructure
2. **Bubblesort** - arrange the number to ascending, sorting algorithm
3. **MergeSort** - arrange the number to ascending, sorting algorithm
4. **Linkedlist** - implementation of linkedlist
5. **Stacks** - implementation of stack
